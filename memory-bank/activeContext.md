# Active Context: Alifiya Parekh Professional Website

## Current Focus
The project is moving from initial setup to component implementation phase. We are expanding the website's content structure with essential sections to showcase Alifiya Parekh's professional experience, skills, and projects.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank documentation structure
- Reviewed the initial React project setup created with Create React App
- Identified component structure based on the system architecture design
- Updated HeroSection to use the actual profile image (alifiya-pic.png) instead of a placeholder element
- Implemented Projects section with a table-based layout and added project document links
- Integrated Projects section into the main application flow
- Simplified Contact section by removing the contact form
- Fixed navigation and scrolling functionality in the HeroSection
- Updated button text from "Get In Touch" to "Contact Me" to match section title
- Added Testimonials section with a carousel design for space efficiency
- Added sample testimonial data to populate the Testimonials section, replacing the "No testimonials available" message

## Active Decisions
1. **Styling Approach**: Decided to use custom CSS instead of Tailwind CSS for more precise control over styling and reduced bundle size. This decision is reflected in the journal entry "2025_05_03_tailwind_removal.md".

2. **Component Architecture**: Following the modular architecture outlined in systemPatterns.md with separate components for each section of the website:
   - Layout components (Header, Footer, Layout)
   - Section components (Hero, Experience, Skills, Education, Achievements, Contact)

3. **Content Strategy**: Focusing on presenting Alifiya's professional experience in the medical devices industry in a clear, organized manner aligned with industry expectations.

## Technical Focus Areas
1. Refining the component structure
2. Enhancing responsive layout implementation
3. Maintaining consistent styling across components
4. Adding specialized sections for different aspects of professional experience

## Next Steps
1. Continue developing remaining section components
2. Refine the Projects section with additional features if needed
3. Consider adding profile images to testimonials if available
4. Improve responsive styling for all components
5. Add animations and transitions for better user experience
6. Test across devices and browsers

## Open Questions
1. Should we add additional details to project entries (dates, technologies, outcomes)?
2. Do we need filtering capabilities for the Projects section?
3. Should we add visual elements like icons to represent different project types?
4. Should additional contact methods be included (e.g., social media profiles)?
