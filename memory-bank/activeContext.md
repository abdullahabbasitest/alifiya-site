# Active Context: Alifiya Parekh Professional Website

## Current Focus
The project is in its initial setup phase. We are establishing the foundation for Alifiya Parekh's professional website based on her LinkedIn profile and using the reference site http://aishwarya.ai for design inspiration.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank documentation structure
- Reviewed the initial React project setup created with Create React App
- Identified component structure based on the system architecture design
- Updated HeroSection to use the actual profile image (alifiya-pic.png) instead of a placeholder element

## Active Decisions
1. **Styling Approach**: Decided to use custom CSS instead of Tailwind CSS for more precise control over styling and reduced bundle size. This decision is reflected in the journal entry "2025_05_03_tailwind_removal.md".

2. **Component Architecture**: Following the modular architecture outlined in systemPatterns.md with separate components for each section of the website:
   - Layout components (Header, Footer, Layout)
   - Section components (Hero, Experience, Skills, Education, Achievements, Contact)

3. **Content Strategy**: Focusing on presenting Alifiya's professional experience in the medical devices industry in a clear, organized manner aligned with industry expectations.

## Technical Focus Areas
1. Creating the basic component structure
2. Implementing responsive layout
3. Establishing consistent styling system
4. Gathering and organizing content from LinkedIn profile

## Next Steps
1. Create directory structure for components
2. Implement the Layout component to provide the page structure
3. Develop the Header component with navigation
4. Implement the HeroSection with introduction
5. Build out the ExperienceSection to showcase professional history
6. Create the remaining section components
7. Implement responsive styling
8. Test across devices and browsers

## Open Questions
1. Need to gather more specific information about Alifiya's key projects and achievements that should be highlighted
2. Determine which projects or case studies should be featured prominently
3. Identify any specific medical device industry certifications to showcase
4. Consider what contact methods should be included (form, email, LinkedIn)
