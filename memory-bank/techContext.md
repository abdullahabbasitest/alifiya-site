# Technical Context: Alifiya Parekh Professional Website

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js (v19.1.0) - Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Rendering**: Client-side rendering
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with component-scoped CSS files

### Development Environment
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (react-scripts v5.0.1)
- **Code Quality**: ESLint with React App configuration
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## Dependencies
```
"dependencies": {
  "@testing-library/dom": "^10.4.0",
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.6.3",
  "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0",
  "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
  "react": "^19.1.0",
  "react-dom": "^19.1.0",
  "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
  "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
}
```

## Technical Decisions

### CSS Approach
Initially, Tailwind CSS was considered for the project, but later removed in favor of custom CSS for more fine-grained control over the styling. This decision allows for:
- More control over specificity
- Smaller bundle size without unused styles
- Cleaner component code without lengthy class lists

### Component Structure
- Component files are organized by function (layout components, section components)
- Each major section of the website has its own dedicated component
- CSS modules are used to maintain style encapsulation

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization for faster loading
- Code splitting at the component level
- Lazy loading of below-the-fold content

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach using CSS media queries
- Flexible layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Viewport-aware components

## Development Workflow
1. Local development using `npm start` (starts development server)
2. Component testing with Jest/React Testing Library
3. Build process using `npm run build`
4. Static file deployment

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No support needed for legacy browsers (IE11 and below)

## Deployment Strategy
- Static site deployment
- Potential for CI/CD pipeline integration in the future

## Technical Constraints
- Limited use of third-party libraries to minimize dependencies
- Prioritization of accessibility and performance over complex animations
- SEO-friendly structure despite being a SPA

## Future Technical Considerations
- Potential addition of dark mode
- Animation libraries if needed for enhanced UI elements
- Contact form backend integration
