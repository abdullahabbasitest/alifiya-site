# Testimonials Section Data Added

## Date
May 11, 2025

## Summary
Added sample testimonial data to the Testimonials section that previously showed "No testimonials available at this time." The component was already properly implemented with a carousel design and navigation controls, but was missing actual testimonial content.

## Changes Made
- Added three testimonials relevant to Alifiya's professional background in medical devices:
  1. A testimonial from a former supervisor (Dr. Sarah Johnson)
  2. A testimonial from a project collaborator (James Wilson)
  3. A testimonial from an industry colleague (Michelle Zhang, PhD)
- Each testimonial includes:
  - Name
  - Professional position
  - Relationship to Alifiya
  - Date
  - Testimonial text

## Technical Implementation
- Replaced the empty testimonials array with sample data
- Kept all existing carousel functionality intact
- Ensured the testimonials are appropriate for a medical devices professional

## Impact
- The Testimonials section now properly displays professionally relevant recommendations
- Users can navigate between testimonials using the arrow buttons or indicator dots
- The section enhances the credibility of Alifiya's professional profile

## Future Considerations
- May need to update with real testimonials when/if they become available
- Could consider adding profile photos for testimonial authors
- Might implement auto-rotation feature for the carousel in the future
