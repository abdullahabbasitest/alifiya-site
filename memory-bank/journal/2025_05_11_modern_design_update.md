## Rationale
The updated design follows contemporary web trends with increased use of subtle animations, soft shadows, larger border radii, and more vibrant colors. These changes give the site a more modern and professional look while maintaining a clean aesthetic appropriate for a medical devices professional.

The floating animation for the profile image and hover effects for interactive elements add subtle dynamism to the site without being distracting. The new color palette is brighter and more engaging, helping key information stand out while maintaining a professional appearance.
