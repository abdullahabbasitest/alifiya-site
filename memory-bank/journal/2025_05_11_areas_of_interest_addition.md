# Areas of Interest Section Addition

I've created a standalone "Areas of Interest" section that appears above the Contact section in the portfolio site.

## Changes Made:

1. Created new `AreasOfInterestSection.js` component with its own section structure
2. Created `AreasOfInterestSection.css` for styling the new section
3. Updated `App.js` to import and include the new section above the Contact section
4. Modified styling to maintain consistency with the rest of the site

## Areas of Interest Content:

The areas of interest listed are:
- Quality assurance
- Regulatory affairs
- Regulatory operations
- Program management
- Any other opportunity aligned with Alifiya's background of interest

These additions provide visitors with a clearer understanding of Alifiya's professional interests and job preferences.

## Implementation Notes:

The Areas of Interest section is now a standalone section in the site's structure rather than being nested within the Contact section. This gives it proper prominence and separation in the user interface.
