# 2025-05-11: Brighter Color Theme Update

## Changes Made
- Updated the color palette to use brighter, more vibrant colors
- Changed the primary color from #3a56a7 (darker royal blue) to #4285F4 (brighter royal blue)
- Changed the secondary color from #ff7e67 (coral) to #FF6B6B (brighter coral)
- Changed the tertiary color from #4ecdc4 (teal) to #00BCD4 (brighter teal)
- Changed the accent color from #f9d89c (soft yellow) to #FFD166 (brighter yellow)
- Brightened the gradient values to match the new color scheme
- Slightly brightened the section background colors for a fresher look

## Rationale
The updated color scheme maintains the professional aesthetic suitable for a medical devices professional while offering a brighter, more engaging visual experience. The brighter blues and accent colors create a more modern and vibrant appearance without sacrificing the professional nature of the website.

## Files Modified
- src/index.css (updated CSS variables in the :root selector)

## Technical Notes
- The website uses CSS variables for consistent theming across all components
- All color changes are managed through the root variables, maintaining the DRY principle
- Gradients were adjusted to complement the new base colors
