# Component Implementation - May 3, 2025

## Context
Following the initial project setup, focus has shifted to implementing the component structure for Alifiya Parekh's professional website. This journal documents the creation and implementation of the core components according to the architecture defined in the system patterns documentation.

## Actions Taken

### Directory Structure Creation
1. Created component directory structure:
   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── layout/
   │   │   ├── Header.js
   │   │   ├── Footer.js
   │   │   └── Layout.js
   │   ├── sections/
   │   │   ├── HeroSection.js
   │   │   ├── ExperienceSection.js
   │   │   ├── SkillsSection.js
   │   │   ├── EducationSection.js
   │   │   ├── AchievementsSection.js
   │   │   └── ContactSection.js
   │   └── ui/  # For smaller reusable UI components
   └── styles/
       ├── components/
       │   └── Header.css
       └── sections/
   ```

2. Created initial component files with basic structure

1. **Layout.js**
   - Implemented the main layout wrapper
   - Created structure with header, main content, and footer
   - Added responsive container sizing

2. **Header.js**
   - Created navigation structure
   - Added Alifiya's name and title
   - Implemented responsive navigation menu

3. **Footer.js**
   - Added copyright information
   - Created links to social media profiles
   - Implemented contact information

### Section Components
1. **HeroSection.js**
   - Implemented introduction section
   - Added placeholder for professional headshot
   - Created professional summary statement

2. **ExperienceSection.js**

   - Added placeholder for company logos

3. **Other Section Components**
   - Created basic structure for remaining sections
   - Added appropriate headings and layout containers
   - Implemented placeholder content

## Styling Approach
1. Created component-specific CSS files
2. Established CSS variables for consistent theming:
   ```css
   :root {
     --primary-color: #2e5984;  // Professional blue shade
     --secondary-color: #6c8fb3;
     --accent-color: #d1e1f0;
     --text-color: #333333;
     --light-text: #f8f9fa;
     --background-color: #ffffff;
     --section-background: #f7f9fc;
     --border-color: #e1e4e8;
   }
   ```

3. Implemented responsive styling using media queries

## Decisions Made
1. **Component Granularity**: Decided on medium-grained components that encapsulate meaningful sections rather than extremely fine-grained components
2. **CSS Organization**: Opted for component-specific CSS files for easier maintenance
3. **Responsive Design**: Created mobile-first layouts with appropriate breakpoints

## Challenges
- Ensuring consistent styling across components
- Balancing component reusability with specific design needs
- Managing responsive layout requirements

## Next Steps
1. Populate components with actual content from LinkedIn profile
2. Refine responsive styling
3. Implement animations and transitions
4. Optimize for performance
