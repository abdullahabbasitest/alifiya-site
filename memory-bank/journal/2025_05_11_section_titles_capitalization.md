# Section Titles Capitalization

I've updated the display of section titles in the portfolio site to use full capitalization for increased visual emphasis.

## Changes Made:

1. Updated `AreasOfInterestSection.js` to change "Areas of Interest" to "AREAS OF INTEREST"
2. Updated `ContactSection.js` to change "Contact Me" to "CONTACT ME"

## Implementation Notes:

The capitalization of these section titles provides more visual emphasis and prominence to these important sections of the portfolio site. This styling choice helps draw attention to these sections and creates a stronger visual hierarchy.
