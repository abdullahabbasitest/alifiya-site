# Journal Entry: Profile Image Update

## Date
May 3, 2025

## Changes Made
Today, I updated the hero section of Alifiya's personal website to display her actual profile picture instead of the placeholder element that was previously in place.

### Specific Changes:
1. Modified `HeroSection.js` to replace the placeholder div with an actual image tag that loads the profile picture from the public folder.
2. Updated `HeroSection.css` to style the profile image with appropriate dimensions, border-radius, and border styling to maintain the circular frame effect.
3. Ensured responsiveness by updating the mobile media query to use the same responsive sizing that was previously applied to the placeholder.

## Technical Details
- Used the existing image file located at `public/alifiya-pic.png`
- Added `object-fit: cover` to ensure the image displays properly within the circular frame
- Maintained the same styling properties (shadow, border) for visual consistency

## Observations
This change enhances the professional appearance of the website by replacing the placeholder with Alifiya's actual profile picture. The circular framing and styling remain consistent with the original design, maintaining the site's professional aesthetic.

## Next Steps
Continue working on additional components as outlined in the project brief and active context document. The next focus should be on ensuring all components are fully implemented and responsive.
