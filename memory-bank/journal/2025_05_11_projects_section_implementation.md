# Projects Section Implementation - May 11, 2025

## Context
Based on the user's request and the need to showcase Alifiya's specific project work in the medical devices industry, I've implemented a dedicated Projects section for the website. This section complements the existing Experience section by highlighting specific project accomplishments rather than just roles and responsibilities.

## Actions Taken

### Component Creation
1. Created new component files:
   - `src/components/sections/ProjectsSection.js` - Component implementation
   - `src/components/sections/ProjectsSection.css` - Styling for the component

2. Implemented a table-based layout for the Projects section:
   - Created a responsive table structure
   - Included two columns: "Projects" and "Description"
   - Added styling for hover effects and responsive behavior

3. Populated the section with project data based on the provided information:
   - Gap Analysis - with link to Google Slides presentation
   - 510(k) Premarket Notification - with link to Google Drive document
   - Design Control File - with link to Google Drive document
   - Process Validation - with link to Google Drive document
   - Orthopedic Implant Documentation
   - Regulatory Strategy - with link to Google Drive document

4. Updated `App.js` to:
   - Import the new ProjectsSection component
   - Add it to the component flow between ExperienceSection and EducationSection

### Styling Implementation
1. Created consistent styling that matches the existing site aesthetic:
   - Used the established CSS variables for colors and spacing
   - Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Added hover effects for better user interaction

2. Ensured mobile responsiveness:
   - Added horizontal scrolling for tables on very small screens
   - Adjusted font sizes and padding for mobile views

### Enhancement - Adding Project Links
1. Added links to project documents for direct access:
   - Added hyperlinks to project titles that link to external Google Drive documents and presentations
   - Implemented hover effects for links to improve user experience
   - Ensured all links open in a new tab with appropriate security attributes

## Design Decisions
1. **Table-based Layout**: Chose a table structure for the Projects section to present the information in a clean, organized format that makes scanning for specific projects easier.

2. **Placement**: Positioned the Projects section after the Experience section as it provides additional detail about specific work that complements the broader experience information.

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Used styling to emphasize project titles while keeping descriptions clean and readable.

4. **Interactive Elements**: Added clickable project titles that link to the actual project documents, allowing visitors to view samples of Alifiya's work directly.

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding additional details to project entries if available:
   - Dates or timeframes for each project
   - Technologies or methodologies used
   - Outcomes or results achieved

2. Potential enhancements:
   - Add filtering capabilities if the projects list grows
   - Consider adding visual elements like icons to represent different project types
   - Add a brief description or preview of the linked documents on hover
