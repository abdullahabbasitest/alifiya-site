# 2025_05_11_hero_qualifications_addition

## Changes Made

Added Alifiya's professional qualifications to the hero section of the website.

## Implementation Details

- Added a new line of text displaying "MTech, RAC- Medical devices, RCC-MDR" below her name
- Used the existing `hero-title` CSS class which was already styled appropriately for smaller text beneath the name
- The qualifications appear directly between the name and the field/industry tag

## Technical Notes

This change enhances Alifiya's professional credibility immediately upon visitors landing on the website by:
1. Displaying her academic qualification (MTech)
2. Highlighting her professional certifications (RAC- Medical devices, RCC-MDR)
3. Establishing her authority in the medical device regulatory field

This addition complements the existing industry focus tag (Medical Devices | Diagnostics | Digital Health) by adding specific credentials that validate her expertise in these areas.
