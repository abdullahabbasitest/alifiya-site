# Hero Section Scroll Down Button Removal - May 11, 2025

## Context
After a review of the Hero section, it was determined that the "Scroll Down" button at the bottom of the section was redundant. The Hero section already has clear navigation buttons ("Contact Me" and "View Experience") that provide sufficient user guidance to navigate through the site.

## Changes Made

### Removal from HeroSection Component
- Removed the entire "hero-scrolldown" div from the `src/components/sections/HeroSection.js` file:
  ```jsx
  <div className="hero-scrolldown">
    <a 
      href="#experience"
      className="scrolldown-link"
    >
      <span className="scrolldown-text">Scroll Down</span>
      <span className="scrolldown-arrow">â†“</span>
    </a>
  </div>
  ```

### CSS Cleanup
- Removed all associated CSS classes from `src/components/sections/HeroSection.css`:
  - `.hero-scrolldown`
  - `.scrolldown-link`
  - `.scrolldown-text`
  - `.scrolldown-arrow`
  - `@keyframes bounce` animation that was only used by the scroll down button

## Rationale
1. **Simplification of UI**: The removal creates a cleaner, more focused UI by eliminating redundant navigation elements.
2. **Improved User Experience**: The Hero section now has a clearer call-to-action without the distraction of an additional button.
3. **Consistency**: The site already has consistent navigation through the primary buttons in the Hero section and the main navigation, making the scroll down button unnecessary.
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Removing the button also helps optimize the mobile view where limited screen space is at a premium.

## Impact
This change maintains all existing navigation functionality while streamlining the UI. The "View Experience" button in the Hero section still performs the same function that the removed "Scroll Down" button did, bringing users to the experience section.
